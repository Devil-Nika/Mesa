        "As a Level 1 Character": "• Gain all the traits in the Core Barbarian Traits table.\n• Gain the Barbarian's level 1 features, which are listed in the Barbarian Features table.",
        "Rage": "You can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a Bonus Action if you aren't wearing Heavy armor.\nYou can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\nWhile active, your Rage follows the rules below.\nDamage Resistance. You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.\nRage Damage. When you make an attack using Strengthâwith either a weapon or an Unarmed Strikeâand deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Features table.\nStrength Advantage. You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.\nNo Concentration or Spells. You can't maintain Concentration, and you can't cast spells.\nDuration. The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:\n• Make an attack roll against an enemy.\n• Force an enemy to make a saving throw.\n• Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.\nEach time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.",
        "Unarmored Defense": "While you aren't wearing any armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.",
        "Weapon Mastery": "Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.\nWhen you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Barbarian Features table.",
        "Danger Sense": "You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge perils. You have Advantage on Dexterity saving throws unless you have the Incapacitated condition.",
        "Reckless Attack": "You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage during that time.",
        "Barbarian Subclass": "You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The Path of the Berserker subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Barbarian level or lower.",
        "Primal Knowledge": "You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1.\nIn addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, or Survival. When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.",
        "Ability Score Improvement": "You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see âFeatsâ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.",
        "Extra Attack": "You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.",
        "Fast Movement": "Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing Heavy armor.",
        "Feral Instinct": "Your instincts are so honed that you have Advantage on Initiative rolls.",
        "Instinctive Pounce": "As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.",
        "Brutal Strike": "If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any Advantage on one Strength-based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn't have Disadvantage. If the chosen attack roll hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You have the following effect options.\nForceful Blow. The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to half your Speed straight toward the target without provoking Opportunity Attacks.\nHamstring Blow. The target's Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time â the most recent one.",
        "Relentless Rage": "Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage is active and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.\nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long Rest, the DC resets to 10.",
        "Improved Brutal Strike": "The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike feature.",
        "Persistent Rage": "When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\nIn addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends early if you have the Unconscious condition (not just the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armor.",
        "Indomitable Might": "If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving throw is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.",
        "Epic Boon": "You gain an Epic Boon feat (see âFeatsâ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Irresistible Offense is recommended.",
        "Primal Champion": "You embody primal power. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.\nChannel Rage into Violent Fury\nBarbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker direct their Rage primarily toward violence. Their path is one of untrammeled fury, and they thrill in the chaos of battle as they allow their Rage to seize and empower them.",
        "Frenzy": "If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active, you deal extra damage to the first target you hit on your turn with a Strength-based attack. To determine the extra damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. The damage has the same type as the weapon or Unarmed Strike used for the attack.",
        "Mindless Rage": "You have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions while your Rage is active. If you're Charmed or Frightened when you enter your Rage, the condition ends on you.",
        "Retaliation": "When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to make one melee attack against that creature, using a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.",
        "Intimidating Presence": "As a Bonus Action, you can strike terror into others with your menacing presence and primal power. When you do so, each creature of your choice in a 30-foot Emanation originating from you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the Frightened creature's turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a use of your Rage (no action required) to restore your use of it."

As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice.

A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it's rolled.\nNumber of Uses. You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\nAt Higher Levels.

The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list. Charm Person, Color Spray, Dissonant Whispers, and Healing Word are recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard Features table.

You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class's Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.\nYou can use this class's Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features table.\nIf a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class's Spellcasting feature.\nDivine Spark. As a Magic action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).\nYou roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).\nTurn Undead. As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw.

        "Sear Undead": "Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together.

Clerics who tap into this domain are masters of healing, using that life force to cure many hurts.\nExistence itself relies on the positive energy associated with this domain, so a Cleric of almost any religious tradition might choose it.

        "Blessed Healer": "The healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores Hit Points to one or more creatures other than yourself, you regain Hit Points equal to 2 plus the spell slot's level.",
        "Supreme Healing": "When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or Channel Divinity, don't roll those dice for the healing; instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a creature with a spell, you restore 12."

The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list. Animal Friendship, Cure Wounds, Faerie Fire, and Thunderwave are recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\nIf another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.",
        "Druidic": "You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals; you always have the Speak with Animals spell prepared.\nYou can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check but can't decipher it without magic.",
        "Primal Order": "You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.\nMagician. You know one extra cantrip from the Druid spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1).\nWarden. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor.",
        "Wild Shape": "The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see âKnown Formsâ below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.\nNumber of Uses. You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\nYou gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table.\nKnown Forms. You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see âAnimalsâ in âMonstersâ for stat block options). The Rat, Riding Horse, Spider, and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form.\nWhen you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.\nWhen choosing known forms, you may look in other sources for eligible Beasts if the Game Master permits you to do so.\nRules While Shape-Shifted. While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:\n• Temporary Hit Points. When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level.\n• Game Statistics. Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast's stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast's stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.\n• No Spellcasting. You can't cast spells, but shapeshifting doesn't break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you've already cast.\n• Objects. Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form's limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it's practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature's size and shape. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you're in that form.",
        "Wild Companion": "You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal form to aid you. As a Magic action, you can expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the Find Familiar spell without Material components. When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is Fey and disappears when you finish a Long Rest.",
        "Druid Subclass": "You gain a Druid subclass of your choice. The Circle of the Land subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Druid levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Druid level or lower.",
        "Ability Score Improvement": "You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see âFeatsâ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid levels 8, 12, and 16.",
        "Wild Resurgence": "Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required).\nIn addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape (no action required) to give yourself a level 1 spell slot, but you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.",
        "Elemental Fury": "The might of the elements flows through you. You gain one of the following options of your choice.\nPotent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Druid cantrip.\nPrimal Strike. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or a Beast form's attack in Wild Shape, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (choose when you hit).",
        "Improved Elemental Fury": "The option you chose for Elemental Fury grows more powerful, as detailed below.\nPotent Spellcasting. When you cast a Druid cantrip with a range of 10 feet or greater, the spell's range increases by 300 feet.\nPrimal Strike. The extra damage of your Primal Strike increases to 2d8.",
        "Beast Spells": "While using Wild Shape, you can cast spells in Beast form, except for any spell that has a Material component with a cost specified or that consumes its Material component.",
        "Epic Boon": "You gain an Epic Boon feat (see âFeatsâ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended.",
        "Archdruid": "The vitality of nature constantly blooms within you, granting you the following benefits.\nEvergreen Wild Shape. Whenever you roll Initiative and have no uses of Wild Shape left, you regain one expended use of it.\nNature Magician. You can convert uses of Wild Shape into a spell slot (no action required). Choose a number of your unexpended uses of Wild Shape and convert them into a single spell slot, with each use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if you convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level 4 spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\nLongevity. The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every ten years that pass, your body ages only one year.\nCelebrate Connection to the Natural World\nThe Circle of the Land comprises mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites. These Druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of their communities.",
        "Circle of the Land Spells": "Whenever you finish a Long Rest, choose one type of land: arid, polar, temperate, or tropical. Consult the table below that corresponds to the chosen type; you have the spells listed for your Druid level and lower prepared.",
        "Land's Aid": "As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and choose a point within 60 feet of yourself. Vitality-giving flowers and life-draining thorns appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point. Each creature of your choice in the Sphere must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. One creature of your choice in that area regains 2d6 Hit Points.\nThe damage and healing increase by 1d6 when you reach Druid levels 10 (3d6) and 14 (4d6).",
        "Natural Recovery": "You can cast one of the level 1+ spells that you have prepared from your Circle Spells feature without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you do so again.\nIn addition, when you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Druid level (round up), and none of them can be level 6+. For example, if you're a level 6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels' worth of spell slots. You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a level 2 and a level 1 spell slot, or three level 1 spell slots. Once you recover spell slots with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.",
        "Nature's Ward": "You are immune to the Poisoned condition, and you have Resistance to a damage type associated with your current land choice in the Circle Spells feature, as shown in the Nature's Ward table.",
        "Nature's Sanctuary": "As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and cause spectral trees and vines to appear in a 15-foot Cube on the ground within 120 feet of yourself. They last there for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition or die. You and your allies have Half Cover while in that area, and your allies gain the current Resistance of your Nature's Ward while there.\nAs a Bonus Action, you can move the Cube up to 60 feet to ground within 120 feet of yourself."

The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1â5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.\nFor example, when you're a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell Charm Person, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. Charm Person and Hex are recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1â3.\nIf another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.\nSpellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.",
        "Magical Cunning": "You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.",
        "Warlock Subclass": "You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The Fiend Patron subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Warlock level or lower.",
        "Ability Score Improvement": "You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see âFeatsâ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels 8, 12, and 16.",
        "Contact Patron": "In the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the Contact Other Plane spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell's saving throw.\nOnce you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest.",
        "Mystic Arcanum": "Your patron grants you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this arcanum.\nYou can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again.\nAs shown in the Warlock Features table, you gain another Warlock spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels 13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9 spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a Long Rest.\nWhenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level.",
        "Epic Boon": "You gain an Epic Boon feat (see âFeatsâ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended.",
        "Eldritch Master": "When you use your Magical Cunning feature, you regain all your expended Pact Magic spell slots.\nEldritch Invocation options appear in alphabetical order.",
        "Dark One's Blessing": "When you reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your Charisma modifier plus your Warlock level (minimum of 1 Temporary Hit Point). You also gain this benefit if someone else reduces an enemy within 10 feet of you to 0 Hit Points.",
        "Fiend Spells": "The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Fiend Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.\nYou can call on your fiendish patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add 1d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), but you can use it no more than once per roll. You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\nChoose one damage type, other than Force, whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest. You have Resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature.\nOnce per turn when you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can try to instantly transport the target through the Lower Planes. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, or the target disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. The target takes 8d10 Psychic damage if it isn't a Fiend, and it has the Incapacitated condition until the end of your next turn, when it returns to the space it previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it."
