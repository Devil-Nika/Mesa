Use the appropriate column of the Deck of Many Things table when randomly determining cards drawn from the deck. Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once. Once a card is drawn, it disappears. Unless the card is the Fool or Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice. (Once the Fool or Jester has left the deck, reroll on the table if that card comes up again.) Each card's effect is described below. **Balance**:  You can increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 22, provided you also decrease another one of your ability scores by 2. You can't decrease an ability that has a score of 5 or lower. Alternatively, you can choose not to adjust your ability scores, in which case this card has no effect. **Comet**:  The next time you enter combat against one or more creatures, you can select one of them as your foe when you roll . If you reduce your foe to 0 during that combat, you have on Death Saving Throws for 1 year. If someone else reduces your chosen foe to 0 or you don't choose a foe, this card has no effect. **Donjon**:  You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you're wearing and carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts, which stay behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any Divination magic, but a spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards. **Euryale**:  The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty to saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the Fates card can end this curse. **Fates**:  Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die. **Flames**:  A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and torments you, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies. **Fool**:  You have on for the next 72 hours. Draw another card; this draw doesn't count as one of your declared draws. **Gem**:  Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 GP each or fifty gems worth 1,000 GP each appear at your feet. **Jester**:  You have on for the next 72 hours, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws. **Key**:  A Rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears on your person. The DM chooses the weapon. **Knight**:  You gain the service of a , who magically appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the same alignment as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the two of you have been drawn together by fate. Work with your DM to create a name and backstory for this NPC. The DM can use a different stat block to represent the knight, as desired. **Moon**:  You gain the ability to cast times. **Puzzle**:  Permanently reduce your Intelligence or Wisdom by (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws. **Rogue**:  An NPC of the DM's choice becomes toward you. You don't know the identity of this NPC until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you. **Ruin**:  All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. If you have a Bastion (see the ), it is destroyed by some calamity beyond your control.

Any Undead that starts its turn in that area takes Radiant damage. **Fire Opal Flames**:  As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can take a action to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit in a 10-foot radius and for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra Fire damage. The flames last until you take a to extinguish them or until you drop or stow the weapon. **Ruby Resistance**:  As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have to Fire damage. **Spells**:  You can cast one of the following spells (save ), using one of the helm's gems of the specified type as a component: (opal), (fire opal), (diamond), or (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm. **Taking Fire Damage**:  Roll if you are wearing the helm and take Fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems and is then destroyed. Each creature within a 60-foot originating from you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking Radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm.",

When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top. If any of its pouches is overloaded, pierced, or torn, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an Artifact always turns up again somewhere.

The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.",

The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, HP 10, to Poison and Psychic damage, and to Bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 . If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a action and use a command word to activate it. It remains activated until you take a action and repeat the command word to deactivate it. Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of the mirror must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. A creature that knows the mirror's nature makes the save with , and Constructs succeed on the save automatically. An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed. If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it. While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can take a action to name one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate. In a similar way, you can take a action and use a second command word to free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it. Placing the mirror inside an extradimensional space created by a , Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.",

      "description": "Long ago, in the Dragonlance setting, elves and humans waged a terrible war against chromatic dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and forged five Orbs of Dragonkind to help defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic. As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped over the centuries. Their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, but they also allow some measure of control over dragons. Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those who try to wield an orb's magic but lack sufficient force of personality might find themselves under the orb's control. An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it. While attuned to an orb, you can take a action to peer into the orb's depths. You must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed save, the orb imposes the condition on you for as long as you remain attuned to it. While you are by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your to it, and the orb casts on you at will (save ), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular society or organization, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of , or something else the DM decides. **Random Properties**:  An Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties: **Spells**:  The orb has 7 charges and regains expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. **Call Dragons**:  While you control the orb, you can take a action to cause the orb to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Chromatic dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as are unaffected by this call. Chromatic dragons drawn to the orb might be toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour. **Destroying an Orb**:  An Orb of Dragonkind has AC 20 and is destroyed if it takes damage from a +3 Weapon or a spell. Nothing else can harm it.",

If you issue no commands to a swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a swarm starts its turn more than 30 feet away from you, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.",

You can take a action to unfold a Portable Hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the Portable Hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane of existence, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open Portable Hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it. You can take a action to close a Portable Hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing. If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can take an action to make a Strength () check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the Portable Hole. A closed Portable Hole holds enough air for 1 hour of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside. Placing a Portable Hole inside an extradimensional space created by a , , or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.",
